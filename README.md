# Platter

I have been frustrated in the past when bookmarked recipes disappear and I have to track down replacements. The purpose of Platter is to have an integrated system for saving recipes in a easy to handle, lightweight format. 

This will be achieved in two stages:

 - Stage one involves the user using a browser plugin to manually select the elements of the recipe. These are sent to the website where they can be viewed and modified. In addition to the selected information, the whole webpage will be stored but hidden from the user to be used in stage two.

 - Stage two will use machine learning on the data set generated by users manually selecting the relevant elements to automatate this process.

 - Stage three is try and remember the raspberry cheesecake recipe that kicked this all off.
